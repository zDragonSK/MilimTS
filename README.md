# Milim.ts
*A Discord application (bot) made using the Discord library.*

### Application purpose
As I'm creating this bot to test DiscordX, I focused only on moderation and utilities of the servers I'm on. I don't have any grand or special goals for this application.

### How to run
To run the application, you need to create an `.env` file, and then build it using `npm run build:start`. It is necessary that you already have an application registered on the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers) and have your token.

### .env proto:
```.env
TOKEN="Your_token_here"
```
